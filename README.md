# Facial Expression Recognizer

This is a group project to develop a deep learning neural network that can recognise a range of facial expression 
based on 2D image inputs. The expressions recognised are Happy, Neutral, Sad, Fear, Angry, Surprise, and Disgust.
The neural network chosen is Convolution Neural Network due to its better performance with image data.
